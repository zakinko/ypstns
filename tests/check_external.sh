# Check the bundled third party code under external/ against external/MANIFEST.
#
# Two separate questions, because they fail for different reasons and want
# different answers:
#
#   integrity   do the bundled files still match the recorded checksums?
#               A mismatch means somebody edited a bundled copy in place,
#               which is exactly what must not happen: the whole point of
#               recording an upstream revision is that the copy is that
#               revision and nothing else.  Checked on every build.
#
#   freshness   is the recorded revision still upstream's current one, and
#               does upstream at that revision still match what is bundled?
#               A mismatch means the copy has quietly rotted.  Needs the
#               network, so it is checked on a schedule with --upstream.
